# Operation Politibot

Operation Politibot is a bot designed for the [Operation Politics Discord Server](htttps://discord.gg/Axa8TXsHXc) by `ùìªùì™ùîÇ#4390`.

This bot offers a wide variety of functionality ranging from Moderation, auto-Moderation, and much more.

We give full credit to all of our information provided by APIs. Whenever you run a command that uses an API, you will be given an embed footer with necessary accreditation. Our bot makes gathering the information these APIs collect extremely easy and straightforward, and provides it in an easily-accessible Discord server for the public to use. 

## This bot will not work out of the box, as you are expected to be able to compile your own config files whatnot. They obviously cannot be included here for sensitivity reasons.

If you have any questions, join our server or DM `ray4390` on Discord.

At some point a branch of this bot will be uploaded for public access and public usage. This bot is specifically designed for the Operation Politics Discord Server.
