## 🚨 About

**Operation Politibot** is a custom-built moderation and auto-moderation bot designed exclusively for the [Operation Politics Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Axa8TXsHXc). It combines advanced moderation tools with public information access via API integrations.

Features include:

- 🛡️ Robust moderation commands  
- 🤖 Auto-moderation and rule enforcement

You will need to:

- Create and configure your own `.env` / `config.json` files  
- Provide your own API keys, channel IDs, and other credentials  
- Customize settings based on your server's specific needs
